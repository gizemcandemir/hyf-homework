TURKISH VEGAN LENTIL MEATBALLS

INGREDIENTS

1 cup red lentils
4 cups water
1 and ½ cup fine bulgur
½ cup olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 teaspoons salt
¼ cup parsley, chopped
¼ cup chopped green onions
2 tablespoons lemon juice

INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Wash the red lentils well and put them in a large pot. Pour water over them and bring them to a simmer uncovered on medium low heat. Let it simmer until lentils are tender.
2. Once most of the water is gone, remove from heat and add in bulgur and cover. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes so that bulgur absorbs the rest of the water and gets tender.
3. Meanwhile, in a small sauce pan, saute the chopped onion in the olive oil until golden. Add in tomato paste, cumin, black pepper and chili powder. Stir well.
4. Transfer the sauted onion mixture into the bulgur and lentil mixture. Stir well and then transfer it into a larger bowl.
5. Add in salt, parsley, green onions and lemon juice. Mix well with your hands. Taste and adjust the amount of salt to your taste.
6. Line a serving platter with lettuce leaves or other herbs. Make your meatballs dipping your fingers into some extra olive oil so that it doesn’t get sticky and place them on the lettuce leaves. Repeat until all the mixture is finished.
7. Serve them with extra lettuce leaves, herbs and pickles.
